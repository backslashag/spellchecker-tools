## Files & Structure

### de-ch
This directory contains the extension which in general can be downloaded in scope of libre office extension. We will enhance especially the dictionary file located under:
/de_CH_frami/de_CH_frami.dic

### additional
The directory additional contains a text file with new words which are not part of the extension yet. We use it in our own spellchecker solution provided by wproofreader to improve the base quality of the dictionary included in the extension. Terms which are listed here should become part of the extension sooner or later, but this takes timeâ€¦ So new terms will be added to the additiona-file first of all and will be mooved to the extension later on.
